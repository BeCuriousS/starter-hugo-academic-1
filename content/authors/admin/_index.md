I'm leading the Medical Sensing Research Group at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the Technische Universit채t Dresden. My research focuses on the development of non-contact medical sensor technologies to ease the future vital sign measurement.

I am currently focused on improving [imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram#Remote_photoplethysmography) which aims to measure vital signs like the heart and breathing rate using video recordings of human skin. In order to achieve this, I'm implementing Machine Learning technologies including artificial neural networks to extract the information from complex data.

I am mainly interested in Machine Learning and its application to real-world problems.
